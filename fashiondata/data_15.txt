Let's make something.



WhatIWore: The red lips and big shades might scream glamorous, but this outfit actually reminds me of Adam! Five out of seven days a week he’s in a red plaid shirt and corduroys during the cold weather months so I had to give him a heads up not to match me while we got dressed this morning. On the other hand, I love coordinating outfits with Felix. So let’s talk about being matchy matchy with your baby…

Where: Breakfast with my boys, walk around the neighborhood
The other day it was matching cream sweaters, but today I put him in this. The waitress at breakfast said how she loves seeing babies dressed like adults and I have to agree! In our house, there’s always a pretty good chance Felix will be dressed to match either his mom or dad.
